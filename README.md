## üìã Abstract

<p>This study aims to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock using regression analysis. The study uses a dataset containing historical stock prices of Yes Bank from Jully 2005 to November 2020. The dataset includes variables such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price and date. The study applies multiple linear regression and other regression techniques to build models that predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock. The models are evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. We have also taken cross validation score into account to finalize the model. The results indicate that both random regressor and XGBoost perform well in predicting the closing price of Yes Bank stock, with random regressor performed well in accuracy parameter. The study concludes that regression analysis can be a useful tool for predicting stock prices and can be valuable for investors in making informed decisions</p>

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap and Navigation guide

The whole project is divided into the six phases, Where in each phase we are dealing with one ascept of the data analysis. As far as the navigation is consorn it's mutch more easy as the process is carried out in phases. for example if we just want we see the analysis then we can directly move to the <b>Process</b> section or if we just what to see the insides then we go ahead and see the <b>Share</b> section of the phase.
In the real-world depending upon the organization the data analysis phases defination may subjected to chage. the the core model is always same. and each phace more or less is representative of that abstract model. So, in this project we try to replicate this real-world abstract process. The main advantage of adopting this model is that the process looks more clear and we have more focus towards goals rether than just chucking the numbers.
<br>

<b>The following bits are clearly explain this abstract process.</b>
<br>

<li><b>Getting and Initial inspection of data</b>.</li>
--> getting data to answer the question and initial inspection of dataset

<li><b>Cleaning the data</b>.</li>
--> Handling all the anomolies in the dataset so that it's ready for analysis

<li><b>Analyzing the data</b>.</li>
--> Analyze the data to find hidden pattern

<li><b>Building various machine learning model</b>.</li>
--> Buliding various regression moddel to assess its prediction capabilities.

<li><b>Analyzing the performance and selecting final model</b>.</li>
--> Final modle selecion via performance matrics and cv scores.

<li><b>Deployment of final model</b>.</li>
--> Put the model in to the real world to fullfill business requirments.
